	abstract={Quality control is a key process designed to ensure that only products satisfying the defined quality requirements reach the end consumer or the next step in a production line. In the food industry, in the packaging step, there are many products that are still evaluated by human operators. To automate the process and improve efficiency and effectiveness, computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques can be applied. This automation is challenging since specific strategies designed according to the application scenario are required. Focusing on the quality control of the sealing and closure of matrix-shaped thermoforming food packages, the aim of the article is to propose a deep-learning-based solution designed to automatically perform the quality control while satisfying production cadence and ensuring 100{\%} inline inspection of the products. Particularly, the designed computer vision system and the image-based criteria defined to determine when a product has to be accepted or rejected are presented. In addition, the vision control software is described with special emphasis on the different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures that have been considered (ResNet18, ResNet50, Vgg19 and DenseNet161, non-pre-trained and pre-trained on ImageNet) and on the specifically designed dataset. To test the solution, different experiments are carried out in the laboratory and also in a real scenario, concluding that the proposed CNN-based approach improves the efficiency and security of the quality control process. Optimal results are obtained with the pre-trained DenseNet161, achieving false positive rates that range from 0.03 to 0.30{\%} and false negative rates that range from 0 to 0.07{\%}, with a rejection rate between 0.64 and 5.09{\%} of production, and being able to detect at least 99.93{\%} of the sealing defects that occur in any production. The modular design of our solution as well as the provided description allow it to adapt to similar scenarios and to new deep-learning models to prevent the arrival of faulty products to end consumers by removing them from the automated production line.},

	abstract = {Abstract The effects of processing parameters on the thermoforming of polymeric foam sheets are highly nonlinear and fully coupled. The complex interconnection of these dominant processing parameters makes the process design a difficult task. In this study, the optimal processing parameters of polypropylene foam thermoforming are obtained by the use of an artificial neural network. Data from tests carried out on a lab-scale thermoforming machine were used to train an artificial neural network, which serves as an inverse model of the process. The inverse model has the desired product dimensions as inputs and the corresponding processing parameters as outputs. The structure, together with the training methods, of the artificial neural network is also investigated. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated by experimental manufacturing of cups with optimal geometry derived from the finite element method. Except the dimension deviation at one location, which amounts to 17.14\%, deviations of the other locations are all below 3.5\%. POLYM. ENG.

	ABSTRACT = {The practical application of a multi-objective optimization strategy based on evolutionary algorithms was proposed to optimize the plastics thermoforming process. For that purpose, in this work, differently from the other works proposed in the literature, the shaping step was considered individually with the aim of optimizing the thickness distribution of the final part originated from sheets characterized by different thickness profiles, such as constant thickness, spline thickness variation in one direction and concentric thickness variation in two directions, while maintaining the temperature constant. As far we know, this is the first work where such a type of approach is proposed. A multi-objective optimization strategy based on Evolutionary Algorithms was applied to the determination of the final part thickness distribution with the aim of demonstrating the validity of the methodology proposed. The results obtained considering three different theoretical initial sheet shapes indicate clearly that the methodology proposed is valid, as it provides solutions with physical meaning and with great potential to be applied in real practice. The different thickness profiles obtained for the optimal Pareto solutions show, in all cases, that that the different profiles along the front are related to the objectives considered. Also, there is a clear improvement in the successive generations of the evolutionary algorithm.},
