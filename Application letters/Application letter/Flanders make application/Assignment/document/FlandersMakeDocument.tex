	\section{Machine learning algorithms:}
	I will list two types of machine learning algorithms that are useful even when we have small data-sets. This is mainly generated by chat gpt.
	\subsection{Reinforcement Learning:}
	Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make a sequence of decisions in an environment in order to maximize a cumulative reward. It's a bit like how humans learn through trial and error. Here's a breakdown of key components:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Agent:} The entity that makes decisions or takes actions within an environment.
		
		\item \textbf{Environment:} The external system or context in which the agent operates. It provides feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on the agent's actions.
		
		\item \textbf{Actions:} The choices the agent can make at each step. These actions impact the state of the environment.
		
		\item \textbf{State:} A representation of the environment at a particular moment. It contains relevant information needed to make decisions.
		
		\item \textbf{Reward:} A numerical signal that the agent receives from the environment after each action. It indicates how good or bad the action was in achieving the agent's goal.
		
		\item \textbf{Policy:} A strategy or set of rules that the agent uses to determine its actions in different states.
	\end{enumerate}
	Reinforcement learning algorithms aim to find an optimal policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time. The agent explores different actions and learns which actions are more likely to lead to higher rewards through trial and error. Some well-known RL applications include training chess-playing and Go-playing robots, as you mentioned. These games provide a clear environment, rules, and rewards (winning or losing), making them suitable for RL training.
	\subsection{Transfer Learning:}
	Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task (the source task) is adapted or fine-tuned for a related but different task (the target task). Instead of training a model from scratch for the target task, transfer learning leverages the knowledge acquired during training on the source task. Here's how it works:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Source Task:} In the source task, a model is trained on a large dataset to learn general features and representations. For example, a model might be trained to recognize a wide variety of objects in images.
		
		\item \textbf{Target Task:} In the target task, which may have a smaller dataset or slightly different requirements, the pre-trained model is used as a starting point. The model's parameters are fine-tuned on the target task's data, adjusting the learned features to fit the new task.
	\end{enumerate}
	Transfer learning is beneficial because it allows the transfer of knowledge from one domain to another, saving time and computational resources. It's especially useful when you have limited data for the target task, as the model starts with some understanding of the problem from the source task. Examples of transfer learning in practice include using pre-trained language models like BERT for various natural language understanding tasks or using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition tasks.
	\subsection{Example: Image Classification with Transfer Learning}
	Suppose you want to create an image classification system to identify different species of birds using deep learning. You have a relatively small dataset of bird images, which is not sufficient to train a deep neural network from scratch. Here's how transfer learning can be applied:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Source Task:} Choose a large dataset of general images, such as ImageNet, which contains millions of images from various categories, including animals, objects, and more.
		Train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) on this dataset to learn general features and representations. The resulting model becomes your pre-trained model.
		
		\item \textbf{Target Task (Bird Classification):} Now, you want to classify bird species using your limited dataset of bird images.
		Instead of starting from scratch, you take the pre-trained model, which has already learned useful features like edges, textures, and object parts from the source task.
		You modify the top layers of the pre-trained model (the output layers) to match the number of bird species you want to classify. These layers are responsible for making the final predictions.
		
		\item \textbf{Fine-Tuning:} You fine-tune the modified model using your bird dataset. This involves updating the weights of the modified layers while keeping the weights of the lower layers (learned from the source task) fixed. During fine-tuning, the model adapts its learned features to become more specialized for bird classification.
		
		\item \textbf{Training:} Train the modified and fine-tuned model on your bird dataset. The model now learns to recognize bird species based on the knowledge it acquired from the source task.
	\end{enumerate}
	By using transfer learning, you leverage the pre-trained model's knowledge of general image features, which can significantly boost the performance of your bird classification task, even with a small dataset. This approach not only saves training time but also improves the model's ability to recognize bird species effectively.
	\\\\
	In practice, you can find pre-trained models, such as VGG, ResNet, or Inception, that have been trained on large image datasets. These models can serve as a starting point for various computer vision tasks, and you can fine-tune them to adapt to your specific needs, whether it's recognizing birds, cars, or any other objects of interest.
