Dear,

I am Tijl. I am a PhD researcher in theoretical physics at the KU Leuven. I am close to finishing my Ph.D. and in stead of persuing academia, I want to explore a different field. I have always been drawn to the computer sciences and I am thinking of applying for jobs in that direction. I have, both during my physics education and during my Ph.D., enjoyed my programming assignments and I am very interested in various computer science concepts. I also visited your company in a past edition of the 'Voka open bedrijven dag' and recall some interesting projects you where involved in. This leads me to my question. To apply to some of your computer science-related vacancies, is it required for me to have formal training in computer science (via the master's education in AI for instance) or are there also jobs that have some of this training in them or allow for me to learn the required concepts by myself?

Thank you in advance,
Tijl Jappens
